Gene Favorites
*******************
Gene Favorites allows you to save selected information from a wide range of Gene identifiers. Unique identifiers are assigned to genes with defining sequences, genes with known map positions, and genes inferred from a distinct sequence of nucleotides forming part of a chromosome, the order of which determines the order of monomers in a polypeptide or nucleic acid molecule which a cell (or virus) may synthesize. These gene identifiers are saved for selection or use in Workbooks. 

* Concept of Gene Favorites, what they are and why you use them
* What terminology is used for genes
* How do I find the genes
* What if I don’t know the gene name
* What if I only know the protein name
* Concept of what a Favorite is (a list of genes)
* What format the gene list has to be in, what if there are errors, are duplicates removed if I re-load the list?
* What does “View System Gene Identifiers” mean, what does it do, why would I use it?
