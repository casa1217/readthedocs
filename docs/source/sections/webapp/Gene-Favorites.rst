**CONCEPT**
 
Gene Favorites allows you to save selected information from a wide range of Gene identifiers. Unique identifiers are assigned to genes with defining sequences, Genes with known map positions, and Genes inferred from a distinct sequence of nucleotides forming part of a chromosome, the order of which determines the order of monomers in a polypeptide or nucleic acid molecule which a cell (or virus) may synthesize. These Gene identifiers are saved for selection or use in Workbooks in the form of . 

**PURPOSE**

Gene Favorite allows you to create a Gene data set (specific to a particular Gene or Project) to analyze. You can build your Gene sequences from thousands of distinct taxonomic identifiers, ranging from viruses to bacteria to eukaryotes or representing specific chromosomes, organelles, plasmids, viruses, transcripts, or specific proteins. From the Menu - Gene selection, you can Manage Gene Favorite, Create Gene Favorite(s) or Select Genes for a New Workbook analysis

**How Do I begin?**

To create a new Gene Favorite - 
  *  You begin by naming the data set (Gene Type or Project Specific); you can create many Favorites and select them when you run you analysis. 
  *  Next select the Gene(s) you’re interested in (you can upload a specific list you’ve previously created/stored, select new Genes by typing them into the input box, or to aid in Gene selection, you can access the HGNC portal (Hugo Gene Nomenclature Committee) via the "View Gene Identifiers" link under this Menu selection. This allows you to focus on specific results or quarries.


* What terminology is used for genes
* How do I find the genes
* What if I don’t know the gene name
* What if I only know the protein name
* Concept of what a Favorite is (a list of genes)
* What format the gene list has to be in, what if there are errors, are duplicates removed if I re-load the list?
* What does “View System Gene Identifiers” mean, what does it do, why would I use it?
