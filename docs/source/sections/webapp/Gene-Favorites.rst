**CONCEPT**
 
Gene Favorites allows you to save selected information from a wide range of Gene identifiers. Unique identifiers are assigned to genes with defining sequences, Genes with known map positions, and Genes inferred from a distinct sequence of nucleotides forming part of a chromosome, the order of which determines the order of monomers in a polypeptide or nucleic acid molecule which a cell (or virus) may synthesize. These Gene identifiers are saved for selection or use in Workbooks in the form of . 

**PURPOSE**

Gene Favorite allows you to create a Gene data set (specific to a particular Gene or Project) to analyze. You can build your Gene sequences from thousands of distinct taxonomic identifiers, ranging from viruses to bacteria to eukaryotes or representing specific chromosomes, organelles, plasmids, viruses, transcripts, or specific proteins. From the Menu - Gene selection, you can Manage Gene Favorite, Create Gene Favorite(s) or Select Genes for a New Workbook analysis

**Creating A Gene Favorite**

To create a new Gene Favorite - 
  *  You begin by **Naming** the data set (Gene Type or Project Specific); you can create many Favorites and select them when you run you analysis. 
  *  Next **Select** the Gene(s) you’re interested in (you can upload a specific list you’ve previously created/stored, select new Genes by typing them into the input box (**Note**: this will auto fill as you type to help you select appropriate Genes).  If duplicate listing are entered they will be marked for your deletion or automatically dropped when saved.  If an error or unknown item is entered it will also be flagged for your attention.  To aid in Gene selection, you can access the HGNC portal (Hugo Gene Nomenclature Committee) via the "`View Gene Identifiers <http://www.genenames.org/>`_" link under this Menu selection. This allows you to focus on specific results or queries.
  * Finally, **Save As Favorite**

**Terminology Used for Genes**
  * The `National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI) <http://www.genome.gov/glossary/index.cfm>`_ created the Talking Glossary of Genetic Terms to help everyone understand the terms and concepts used in genetic research.  In addition to definitions, specialists in the field of genetics share their descriptions of terms, and many terms include images, animation and links to related terms.

**Resources**
  * There are many resources available which provide Gene strings, pre-configured downloads identification of Proteins, etc. For examples see:
     * `Hugo Gene Nomenclature Committee (HGCN) <http://www.genenames.org>`_  or
 
     * `National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) <http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov>`_
