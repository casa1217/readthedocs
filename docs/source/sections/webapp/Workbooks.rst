Workbooks
*******************
Workbooks store the Analyses you create -- and their related data. Basically, the worksheets you create to conduct analysis based on the source data selected (i.e. Genes, Variables and Cohorts).  Workbooks can be used to:
  • Group together multiple related analyses,
  • Share analysis results with specific groups of people,

For example, you can create a workbook (i.e., Study A) which consists of identifying gene mutations and pathways involved in Head and Neck Cancer (and share it with research Group A). 

And create another workbook (i.e., Study B) with a different group of researchers (Group B) investigating the average time after diagnosis of death for different lung cancers.  Think of workbooks as virtual "excel spreadsheets" that various related analyses can be created in individual Worksheets (“Tabs” within the spreadsheet) and grouped together in one Workbook (the overall spreadsheet).

Additionally, you can:
  • Save a workbook for later use, or
  • Edit an existing workbook.

Creating and saving a workbook
##############################

From your dashboard, under Sample Analysis you will find the “Saved Workbooks” panel.  This panel displays any previously created and save workbooks and allows you to “Create a New Workbook”. If you do not have any saved workbooks you will see “Saved Workbooks (0).

To create a workbook from Your Dashboard, click on the “Create a New Workbook” link in the "Saved Workbooks" panel. This will take you to the workbook creation page.

From the Workbook creation panel you will first select one of six analysis types (i.e., Bar chart, Histogram, Scatter Plot, Violin Plot, Violin Plot Axis swap or Chubby Hole Plot). 

You will then select Genes or Variables (or, optionally – both)
  • Genes - 
  • Variables -
