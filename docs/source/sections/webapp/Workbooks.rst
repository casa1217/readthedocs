Workbooks
*******************

Workbooks are used to group together multiple related analyses, and can be used for sharing groups of analysis results with specific groups of people.  Multiple Sample Analyses can be grouped into Workbooks (and saved for later use, editing, and sharing).  For example, you may have one study involving identifying gene mutations and pathways involved in Head and Neck Cancer (with a given research group) where you keep all the files in one Workbook, and another study with a different group of researchers investigating the average time after diagnosis of death of different lung cancers - stored in another Workbook.  Think of workbooks as virtual "excel spreadsheets" that various related analyses can be created in individual Worksheets and grouped together in one Workbook.

Creating and saving a workbook
##############################

From your dashboard, under Sample Analysis you will find the “Saved Workbooks” panel.  This panel displays any previously created and save workbooks and allows you to “Create a New Workbook”. If you do not have any saved workbooks you will see “Saved Workbooks (0).

To create a workbook from Your Dashboard, click on the “Create a New Workbook” link in the "Saved Workbooks" panel. This will take you to the workbook creation page.

From the Workbook creation panel you will first select one of six analysis types (i.e., Bar chart, Histogram, Scatter Plot, Violin Plot, Violin Plot Axis swap or Chubby Hole Plot). 

You will then select Genes or Variables (or, optionally – both)
•	Genes - 
•	Variables -
